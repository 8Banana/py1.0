This directory is a placeholder for the Extensions directory.

Some extensions to Python are not placed in the "core" distribution,
because they are big, old, only relevant to a small number of people,
buggy, incomplete, or (most likely) have a number of these attributes.

I am busy reorganizing the extensions to make it easier to build them;
when they are ready this will be announced on the Python mailing list.

The extensions are distributed as the tar file "extensions.tar.Z", to
be found at the same ftp sites in the same directory as the core
distribution tar file.  This file is not updated as regularly as the
core distribution; the README file there will tell which Python it was
last tested with.  The tar file extracts everything into a
subdirectory named Extensions; this should be a direct subdirectory of
the toplevel directory (i.e. a sibling of Ext-dummy).

Available extensions:

X11 		Guess what?  (Unfortunately this is not stable yet)
af		DEC CRL's AudioFile (probably incomplete)
amoeba		Free University's Amoeba distributed operating system
dos		MS-DOS
gsm		"GSM" audio encoding
jpeg		JPEG image compression
mac		Macintosh OS
ptx		Pseudo TTYs (doesn't work)
suit		U of Virginia's Simple UI Toolkit (not finished)
