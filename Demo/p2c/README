Here I am trying to see how far I can get translating Python to C.


Currently the assumptions are:

- all variables and arguments are of type int

- no reliance on tricky semantics, e.g.:

	= status of for loop variable after loop

	= effect of modifying for loop variable

- generating C only


In the future we need to:

- guess the argument and local variable types

- generate .h and .c files corresponding to module files

- generate not only C but other languages as well

- etc., etc., etc.
